A group $G$ is a set $S$ and a binary operation $$\cdot : S \times S \rightarrow S$$ such that

- **Closure**: $\quad \forall a, b \in G, \quad ab \in G$

- **Associativity**: $\quad \forall a, b, c \in G, \quad a(bc) = (ab)c$

- **Identity**: $\quad \exists e \in G \quad \text{s.t.} \quad \forall a \in G, \quad ae = ea = a$

- **Inverse**: $\quad \forall a \in G \quad \exists b \in G \quad \text{s.t.} \quad ab = ba = e$
<!-- $\forall a, b \in G \exists c$ -->


<!-- $|X/G| = \frac{1}{G} \sum_{g \in G} |X ^ g|$ -->


<!-- $|X / G| = \frac{1}{|G|}(|X^{r_0}| + |X^{r_1}| + |X^{r_2}|) = \frac{1}{3}(8 + 2 + 2) = 4$

The values for $|X^{r_n}|$ come from the number of elements unchanged by $r_n$ by our self imposed invariance laws. I encourage you to verify this by hand.

## A More Complex Example

So what does this have to do with Tsuro tiles? Well in our case our set is simply the $105$ distinct (for now) Tsuro tiles, and our set can be [presented](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/GroupPresentation.html) as $\langle r | r^4 = 1 \rangle$. This is the $C_4$ group! Think about it for a second- rotating a square is fundamentally the same action as cycling beads in a necklace one to the right. $C_4$ has four elements in it- so how many elements in $X$ are fixed by each $g \in C_4$?

By the lemma, $|X / G| = \frac{1}{4} (105 + 5 + 25 + 5) = 35$ -->
