# TsuroLocal

## Some of these are not implemented yet:
- Can play tsuro with up to four players on one computer
- Can see who is looking at the board by selecting using the radio button at the top of screen4
- When a player is not playing (they died) radio button is greyed out)
- When you flick to a current player you can see their inventory
- All players see the same board with tiles coloured base on who placed them, and paths coloured based on who traversed them
- When a player is eliminated the turn no longer automatically rotates to them
- When the game ends a model pops up with a button to download the finished board, and the modal displays the list of winners
- You can select colours on the start page
- You cannot go back to the start page except using the back button and if you do the game will be reset
- As of right now no option to do online multiplayer

## Things to fix/Add (explicit)
- radio button
- player random generation at start of game, still have not determined how that will work
- max number of players increase from 4-> 8
