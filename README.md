# How many TSURO tiles are there?

This project started off as an investigation into [Burnside's Lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside%27s_lemma). After spending enough time playing with drawings of Tsuro tiles, and several programs that generated and categorised various tiles, I thought "might as well fill in the blanks and make this into a proper game".
